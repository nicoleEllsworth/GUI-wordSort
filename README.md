# GUI-wordSort
GUI that allows user to filter and sort word lists by prefix, suffix, tags, and starting letter. This application is primarily designed for writers (especially poets) to aid in finding words. The user can also save the words to the sortedWords.txt file. 

The dictionary for this application (called words.txt) was created via webscraping and manual editing; it is still in progress. Anyone is welcome to add words and tags to this list (see current tag list in the WordForm.java class). Further sorting algorithms may be interesting to add as well, such as sorting by length, rhyme, etc.
